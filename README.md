# SimilarityAlgorithm
A algorithm to find the similarity between to given strings.


## About
I made this algorithm for my project "KahootBot"  This algorithm proved to be the best among many (cosine, jaccard, levenshtein) to meet the needs I had, however this does not mean that in other circumstances my algorithm is in fact "the best".

## Penalty
In the algo there is a else statement with a penalty comment... there you can add a penalty for each wrong letter (in case you need that)
Penalty Example: ( score -= score_per_letter/2 )

#### This is the 3rd and last version of my algorithm, I hope this can be usefull :))
